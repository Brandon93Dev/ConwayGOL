This is a programatic visualisation of Conway's Game of Life

Death: If a live cell has fewer than two or more than three live neighbors, it dies due to loneliness
or overpopulation.   

Survival: If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it survives to the next generation.        
Birth: If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive in the next generation.

Zero-Player Game: Once you set the initial state (the arrangement of live and dead cells), the
game evolves automatically without any further input. Itâ€™s like watching a mesmerizing dance of
patterns emerge and transform
